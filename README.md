# Autoddit
A simple react app

All of my comments in the code are for indication of the work flow and the code writing process.

# Installation

Run `npm install`

*Optional - In case of using the mock API

Run `mv .env.example .env` OR copy manually .env.example into .env file.

If using the mock API, enable a chrome extension called CORS

# Running the app
Run `npm start`
